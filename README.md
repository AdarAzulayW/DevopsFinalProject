## Overview

In this final project, our team of DevOps Engineers at HIT corporate has successfully orchestrated a complete DevOps workflow to deploy a simple web application from development into production. Our mission encompassed automating deployment, monitoring, performance testing, and analysis, leveraging the comprehensive knowledge gained from our DevOps course.

## Project Components

- **Web Application Development**: Developed a simple JSP web application featuring a user input text box and a functional button.
- **Version Control**: Utilized Git and GitHub for source code management, ensuring a collaborative and efficient development process.
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated the deployment process using Jenkins, seamlessly moving the application from Git/GitHub to a designated folder in Tomcat's webapps directory, named after our team members.
- **Monitoring**: Implemented application availability monitoring using SiteMonitorLite and UptimeRobot, integrated with Jenkins for continuous monitoring and reliability.
- **Testing Automation**: Conducted automated functional testing using Selenium IDE, including four critical verifications to halt the process upon failure, enhancing the application's robustness.
- **Performance Testing**: Executed a Load Test and a Stress Test with Gatling for four minutes each, simulating up to 90 concurrent users, to ensure the application's performance under various conditions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Git/GitHub** for version control.
- **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Tomcat** as the servlet container for deploying the web application.
- **SiteMonitorLite** and **UptimeRobot** for monitoring application availability.
- **Selenium IDE** for automated functional testing.
- **Gatling** for performance and stress testing.

## Team Contributions

Our project's success was made possible by the collaborative efforts of our team members, each contributing unique skills in coding, deployment, testing, and monitoring to ensure a seamless end-to-end DevOps pipeline.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies the practical application of DevOps principles and tools to achieve an automated, reliable, and efficient workflow for deploying web applications. Our experience reinforces the importance of collaboration, automation, and continuous monitoring in the field of DevOps.
